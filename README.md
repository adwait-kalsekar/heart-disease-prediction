# heart-disease-prediction
Machine Learning Project that uses various classification techniques to predict the possibility of heart disease based on 14 features.
This project is made using Python and its machine learning and data visualisation libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit learn.

## Dataset Information
> Heart Disease Data set published by UCI is used for this project. The dataset was taken from UCI Macine Learning Archives: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease.
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.

## Methods Used for Classification
1. Logistic Regression
2. K Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classification
3. Random Forest Classification

## Setting up the project
> This project can be set up locally using Jupyter Labs or using Google Colab.

* Download the project code in a folder (both dataset and ipynb file should be present in the same folder or edit the path in the code)
* Open the folder in Jupyter Labs or Google Colab
* Run all Cells and Analyse the Results

*This project can also be used as a template for other binary classification projects using required datasets.*
